# steve-jobs-card
A card showing information such as amount of followers he has across all social media platforms and links about his creation.

# Lessons Learned 
The use of a span tag inside another span tag should be avoided.
The use of different naming classes to apply the same styles is unnecessary. For example, ‘span.newRowOne ,span.newRowTwo, span.newRowThree’ could all be just “newRow” class and it could be reused on all three elements.
Nesting Selector on css/scss can make the code hard to read and maintain.

# Potential future features
